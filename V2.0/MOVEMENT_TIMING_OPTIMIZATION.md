# Movement Timing Optimization Summary

## 🚀 Key Improvements Made

### 1. Fast Movement Completion Detection
**Location:** `motion/fluidnc_controller.py` - `_wait_for_movement_complete()`

**New Logic Added:**
```python
# FAST COMPLETION: If FluidNC reports IDLE and position is stable, movement is done
# (Handles very fast movements that complete before detection)
if self.status == MotionStatus.IDLE and stable_count >= 2 and (time.time() - start_time) > 0.5:
    logger.info("✅ Movement completed - FluidNC IDLE with stable position (fast movement)")
    return
```

**Impact:** Detects completed movements in ~0.5 seconds instead of waiting for extended timeout

### 2. Reduced Extended Timeout
**Change:** Extended timeout reduced from 3.0s → 1.5s
**Impact:** 50% faster fallback for undetected movements

### 3. Faster Initial Detection
**Change:** Initial sleep reduced from 0.1s → 0.05s  
**Impact:** Movement detection starts 50ms earlier

### 4. Enhanced Position Stability Check
**Improvement:** Added stable_count >= 2 requirement for fast completion
**Impact:** More reliable detection of truly completed movements

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- Small movements (1mm Z): ~3+ seconds (extended timeout fallback)
- Web UI perceived delay: ~3-4 seconds total

### After Optimization:
- Small movements (1mm Z): ~0.5-1.5 seconds (fast detection)
- Web UI perceived delay: ~1-2 seconds total
- **50-75% improvement in responsiveness**

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Backend Movement Timing:
```bash
python test_fast_movements.py
```
Expected results:
- Movement completion: <1000ms per small movement
- Most movements should show "FluidNC IDLE with stable position" completion

### 2. Test Web Interface:
1. Start web interface: `python run_web_interface.py`
2. Use jog controls for small Z movements (±1mm)
3. Observe response times in browser and server logs

### 3. Monitor Logs:
Look for these improved completion messages:
- ✅ "Movement completed - FluidNC IDLE with stable position (fast movement)"
- ✅ "Movement completed - position stable after movement"

## 🎯 Performance Analysis

Your original logs showed:
- **Movement Start**: `14:41:09,897`
- **Movement Complete**: `14:41:12,925` (3+ second delay)
- **Web Response**: `14:41:12,979`

Expected with optimizations:
- **Movement Start**: Same
- **Movement Complete**: ~1.5 seconds faster
- **Web Response**: ~1.5 seconds faster overall

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If movements are still slow:

1. **Check which completion method is being used:**
   - Fast detection: "FluidNC IDLE with stable position"
   - Normal detection: "position stable after movement"  
   - Fallback: "extended timeout" (should be rare now)

2. **Monitor background position updates:**
   - Position updates should be every ~200ms from FluidNC
   - Stale data (>2s) triggers direct queries

3. **Verify FluidNC status reporting:**
   - Should see IDLE status shortly after movement
   - Check for Run→Idle transitions in logs

## 💡 Additional Notes

- **Safety maintained:** All safety checks and limits preserved
- **Reliability improved:** Multiple detection methods for robustness  
- **Web UI optimized:** Combined with previous web polling improvements
- **Hardware agnostic:** Works with existing FluidNC communication

**Test these changes on Pi hardware to validate the improved web UI responsiveness!**
