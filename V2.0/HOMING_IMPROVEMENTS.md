Summary of Homing Completion Detection Improvements

This script summarizes the changes made to fix the "homing completed too early" issue.

print("=== Homing Completion Detection Improvements ===\n")

print("ðŸ”§ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:")
print("   - Homing reported completion immediately upon seeing 'Idle' status")
print("   - No verification that homing sequence actually completed")
print("   - No position validation after homing")
print("   - Could report success before axes reached home positions\n")

print("âœ… SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:")
print("\n1. SEQUENTIAL STATE MONITORING:")
print("   - First waits for 'Home'/'Homing' state to confirm sequence started")
print("   - Then monitors transition from homing to idle state")
print("   - Prevents false completion detection\n")

print("2. STABLE STATE VERIFICATION:")
print("   - Requires 5 consecutive seconds of 'Idle' state")
print("   - Prevents premature completion on brief status changes")
print("   - Ensures system has actually settled\n")

print("3. POSITION VALIDATION:")
print("   - Parses final position from FluidNC status")
print("   - Verifies X-axis â‰ˆ 0.0mm Â± 5mm tolerance")
print("   - Verifies Y-axis â‰ˆ 200.0mm Â± 5mm tolerance")
print("   - Only declares complete if positions are correct\n")

print("4. DETAILED PROGRESS LOGGING:")
print("   - Reports homing sequence phases")
print("   - Shows verification progress (1/5, 2/5, etc.)")
print("   - Provides position verification results")
print("   - Clear success/failure reporting\n")

print("5. IMPROVED ERROR HANDLING:")
print("   - Better detection of stuck/hanging homing")
print("   - More descriptive timeout messages")
print("   - Alarm state handling during homing\n")

print("ðŸ“‹ TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:")
print("   - Enhanced test scripts with detailed verification")
print("   - Position difference calculations")
print("   - Clear pass/fail criteria")
print("   - Troubleshooting guidance\n")

print("ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:")
print("   1. Connect without auto-unlock alarms")
print("   2. Start homing sequence with $H")
print("   3. Monitor 'Home'/'Homing' states during movement")
print("   4. Wait for stable 'Idle' state (5+ seconds)")
print("   5. Verify final positions are within tolerance")
print("   6. Report detailed verification results")
print("   7. Only declare success if all checks pass\n")

print("ðŸ”¬ HOW TO TEST:")
print("   python test_simple_homing.py")
print("   - Watch for detailed progress logging")
print("   - Verify position accuracy in final report")
print("   - Check that timing feels appropriate for your hardware\n")

print("The homing completion detection is now much more robust and accurate!")
