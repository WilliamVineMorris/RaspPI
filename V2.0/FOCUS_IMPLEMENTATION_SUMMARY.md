# Focus Functionality Implementation Summary

## üéØ Focus System Overview

This document summarizes the complete autofocus functionality that has been added to the 4DOF scanner system. The implementation provides both automatic and manual focus control with consistent focus values across both cameras.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Camera Focus Control Interface (`camera/base.py`)
- **Abstract Methods Added**:
  - `get_focus_value()` - Get current focus position (0.0-1.0)
  - `set_focus_value(value)` - Set manual focus position
  - `auto_focus_and_get_value()` - Perform autofocus and return optimal value

### 2. Pi Camera Controller (`camera/pi_camera_controller.py`)
- **Autofocus Implementation**:
  - Uses Picamera2 `AfMode.Auto` for automatic focusing
  - Reads `LensPosition` metadata for precise focus values
  - Supports both autofocus-capable and manual-only cameras
  - Normalized focus range (0.0 = near, 1.0 = infinity)

### 3. Scan Orchestrator Integration (`scanning/scan_orchestrator.py`)
- **Focus Management**:
  - `_setup_scan_focus()` - Initialize focus before scanning
  - Support for 3 focus modes: 'auto', 'manual', 'fixed'
  - Consistent focus value applied to both cameras
  - Pre-scan autofocus with value retention

- **Public API Methods**:
  - `set_focus_mode(mode)` - Configure focus behavior
  - `set_manual_focus_value(value)` - Set specific focus position
  - `perform_autofocus()` - Trigger immediate autofocus
  - `get_focus_settings()` - Get current focus configuration

### 4. Web API Endpoints (`web/web_interface.py`)
- **Focus Control Routes**:
  - `POST /api/scan/focus/mode` - Set focus mode (auto/manual/fixed)
  - `POST /api/scan/focus/value` - Set manual focus value
  - `GET /api/scan/focus/settings` - Get current focus configuration
  - `POST /api/scan/focus/autofocus` - Trigger autofocus operation

## üîß Technical Details

### Focus Value System
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (normalized across all cameras)
- **0.0**: Near focus (macro/close-up)
- **1.0**: Infinity focus (distant objects)
- **Validation**: Automatic clamping to valid range

### Focus Modes
- **'auto'**: Automatic focus before each scan, value retained
- **'manual'**: User-specified focus value (0.0-1.0)
- **'fixed'**: Keep current focus position unchanged

### Error Handling
- Camera capability detection (autofocus vs manual-only)
- Graceful fallback for unsupported operations
- Comprehensive error messages and logging

## üìã Testing

### Test Script: `test_focus_functionality.py`
Comprehensive test coverage including:
- Focus mode configuration testing
- Manual focus value setting
- Autofocus operation validation
- Dual camera coordination
- Error handling scenarios

### Usage Example:
```bash
cd RaspPI/V2.0
python test_focus_functionality.py
```

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### For Pi Hardware Testing:
1. **Deploy Code**: Copy updated files to Raspberry Pi
2. **Test Basic Function**: Run `test_focus_functionality.py`
3. **Web Interface**: Access focus controls via web UI
4. **Hardware Validation**: Test with Pi cameras that support autofocus

### Required Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi cameras with autofocus capability (Pi Camera Module 3 or compatible)
- Or manual lens control support for fixed focus cameras

## üåê Web Interface Integration

### API Usage Examples:

**Set Auto Focus Mode:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://pi-ip:5000/api/scan/focus/mode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "auto"}'
```

**Set Manual Focus:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://pi-ip:5000/api/scan/focus/value \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 0.7}'
```

**Trigger Autofocus:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://pi-ip:5000/api/scan/focus/autofocus
```

**Get Current Settings:**
```bash
curl http://pi-ip:5000/api/scan/focus/settings
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Focus Stacking (Not Yet Implemented)
The current implementation provides the foundation for future focus stacking features:
- Multiple focus positions per scan point
- Focus bracketing support
- Extended depth of field capture

### Advanced Features for Later:
- Per-position focus adjustment
- Focus map generation
- Adaptive focus based on scan subject distance

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions:
- **Modular Architecture**: Focus control follows existing abstract base class pattern
- **Dual Camera Sync**: Both cameras use same focus value for consistency
- **Normalized Values**: 0.0-1.0 range simplifies cross-camera compatibility
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of unsupported camera features

### Integration Points:
- Scan orchestrator calls `_setup_scan_focus()` before each scan
- Web API provides immediate focus control access
- Camera controllers handle hardware-specific focus implementation

## üéâ Status: Ready for Pi Hardware Testing!

The complete autofocus functionality has been implemented and is ready for deployment to Raspberry Pi hardware. All code changes maintain the existing modular architecture and provide comprehensive error handling for robust operation.

**Next Step**: Deploy to Pi and test with actual camera hardware to validate autofocus performance and integration.
