# üéØ LENS INVERSION FIX - QUICK REFERENCE

## The Problem
**ALL focus values were inverted!** Slider worked backwards - moving UP focused FARTHER instead of CLOSER.

## The Fix
Removed lens position inversion from all focus conversion code.

**Changed from:**
```python
lens_position = int((1.0 - focus_value) * 1023)  # ‚ùå WRONG
```

**To:**
```python  
lens_position = int(focus_value * 1023)  # ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

## Testing

1. **Restart scanner**: `sudo systemctl restart scanner`
2. **Test slider**: Move from 6‚Üí10mm, should focus closer
3. **Check logs**: Should see `ACTUAL LENS POSITION: 511 ‚Üí Focus: 0.500 (8.0mm)` for 8mm setting
4. **Verify images**: 8mm should focus at middle distance (not far!)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

| Slider Value | Lens Position | Focus Distance |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 6.0mm | 0 | Far (infinity) |
| 8.0mm | 511 | Middle |
| 10.0mm | 1023 | Near (macro) |

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `camera/pi_camera_controller.py` (8 locations)
- ‚úÖ `scanning/scan_orchestrator.py` (1 location - diagnostic)

## What's Now Fixed

‚úÖ Slider direction correct (up=closer, down=farther)
‚úÖ Focus accuracy (lens goes to right position)  
‚úÖ Dashboard/scan consistency (same focus = same result)
‚úÖ Diagnostic logging (shows correct conversions)

**Deploy this immediately - it fixes fundamental focus behavior!**
