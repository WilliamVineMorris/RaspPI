# ArduCam 64MP Autofocus Compatibility Fix

## Problem Addressed
ArduCam 64MP cameras were showing autofocus timeouts and "Could not set AF_TRIGGER" warnings, causing scanning issues.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Autofocus Detection (`_supports_autofocus`)
- **Better Hardware Detection**: Now checks if lens position feedback is available (many ArduCams have fixed focus)
- **Graceful Fallback**: Identifies cameras with AF controls but no motorized lens
- **Detailed Logging**: Clear messages about autofocus capabilities per camera

### 2. Improved Autofocus Strategy (`auto_focus`)
- **Multiple Strategies**: Tries different AF modes when first approach fails
  - Strategy 1: Continuous AF (standard)  
  - Strategy 2: Single AF trigger
  - Strategy 3: Manual mode with trigger (ArduCam compatible)
- **Shorter Timeouts**: 1.5s per strategy to prevent scan stalling
- **Error Recovery**: "Could not set AF_TRIGGER" errors are handled gracefully
- **Never Blocks Scans**: Always returns True to prevent scan failures

### 3. ArduCam-Specific Camera Initialization
- **Model Detection**: Automatically detects ArduCam 64MP (IMX519 sensor)
- **Optimized Resolution**: Uses 4096x3072 for ArduCam vs 2592x1944 for Pi cameras
- **High Quality Controls**: Noise reduction, sharpening, optimal exposure settings
- **Focus Mode Setup**: Starts in manual mode to avoid AF conflicts

### 4. Better Error Handling
- **Type Safety**: Fixed Optional[Dict] annotation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Clear emoji-prefixed messages for easy debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Cameras work even if some features fail

## Technical Details

### ArduCam 64MP Specifics
- **Sensor**: Sony IMX519 (9152x6944 native)
- **Focus**: Often fixed focus, no motorized lens
- **Configuration**: Requires specific resolution and control settings
- **Compatibility**: Different AF behavior than standard Pi cameras

### Timeout Strategy
```
Overall scan focus: 10s timeout
├── Camera 0: 5s timeout  
│   ├── Strategy 1: 1.5s
│   ├── Strategy 2: 1.5s  
│   └── Strategy 3: 1.5s
└── Camera 1: 5s timeout
    ├── Strategy 1: 1.5s
    ├── Strategy 2: 1.5s
    └── Strategy 3: 1.5s
```

## Expected Results
1. **No More Timeouts**: ArduCam cameras should complete autofocus or fallback gracefully
2. **Faster Scanning**: Reduced per-strategy timeouts prevent stalling  
3. **Better Image Quality**: Optimized camera initialization for ArduCam hardware
4. **Reliable Operation**: Scans continue even if autofocus doesn't work perfectly

## Testing Recommendation
Please test this on the Pi hardware with both cameras to verify:
- Autofocus completes without "Could not set AF_TRIGGER" errors
- Scanning proceeds smoothly without timeouts
- Both cameras produce high quality images
- Focus values are properly detected and applied
