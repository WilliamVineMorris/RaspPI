│   └── deprecated/            # Old/obsolete files
└── cleanup_backup/            # Backup of original state
```

## Recovery

If you need to restore the original state:
```bash
# All original files are backed up in cleanup_backup/
cp cleanup_backup/* .
```

## Next Steps

1. Verify system still works: `python run_web_interface.py`
2. Run tests: `python tests/unit/test_core_infrastructure.py`
3. Remove cleanup_backup/ when satisfied with organization

## Summary

✅ Directory cleanup completed successfully!
✅ Files organized into logical directories
✅ Deprecated files archived
✅ Documentation created
✅ Original files safely backed up

The manual controls and web interface should continue working normally.
You now have a much cleaner and more organized codebase!
