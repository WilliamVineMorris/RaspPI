# Smart Polling Web Interface Test

## Test the Enhanced Web Interface

The web interface now includes **smart adaptive polling** that should provide much more responsive position updates:

### 🔧 **New Features**
- **Fast polling** (500ms) during movement and on manual control page
- **Slow polling** (2000ms) during idle periods  
- **Automatic switching** based on system state
- **Jog command tracking** for responsive updates after jogging
- **Enhanced debugging** to identify position lag sources

### 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5) to load new JavaScript
2. **Open browser console** (F12) to see debug logs
3. **Navigate to manual control** page: `http://raspberrypi:8080/manual`

### 📊 **Expected Behavior**

#### **On Manual Control Page:**
- Console should show: `"Polling interval set to 500ms (fast mode)"`
- Position updates every 500ms instead of 2000ms
- More responsive position display

#### **After Jog Commands:**
- Console should show: `"Jog command sent - enabling fast polling"`
- Fast polling continues for 10 seconds after jog
- Position updates should appear within 1-2 seconds of jog completion

#### **Debug Logs to Look For:**
```javascript
Scanner base initialized
Smart HTTP polling established
Polling interval set to 500ms (fast mode)
Jog command sent - enabling fast polling
Position update: {"x":0.0,"y":200.0,"z":6.309,"c":0.0}, data age: 0.8s
```

### 🎯 **Success Criteria**

✅ **Responsive Position Updates**: Position changes visible within 1-2 seconds of jog completion
✅ **Smart Polling**: Fast polling (500ms) on manual page, slow polling (2000ms) on other pages  
✅ **Data Age Improvement**: Position data age should be < 1 second during active use
✅ **No Overwhelming**: Server logs still show controlled request patterns
✅ **Stable Connection**: No flickering connection status

### 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

If position updates are still slow:
1. Check browser console for polling interval messages
2. Verify data age values in debug logs  
3. Confirm fast polling activates on manual control page
4. Check if jog commands trigger fast polling mode

**The smart polling should provide the responsive position updates you need while maintaining efficient server communication!**
