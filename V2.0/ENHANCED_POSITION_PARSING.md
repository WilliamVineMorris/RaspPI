# FluidNC Position Parsing Enhancement

## Enhanced Position Parsing for All FluidNC Message Formats

The FluidNC controller has been enhanced to handle **all possible message formats** and capture position data from any FluidNC message that contains coordinate information.

### üîß **Enhanced Features:**

1. **Comprehensive Message Parsing:**
   - Processes ALL FluidNC messages, not just status reports
   - Multiple regex patterns for different coordinate formats
   - Handles 4-axis and 6-axis machine variations
   - Flexible spacing and formatting tolerance

2. **Robust Status Detection:**
   - Multiple keywords for each status (IDLE/IDL, RUN/JOG/RUNNING, etc.)
   - Case-insensitive pattern matching
   - Enhanced alarm code extraction

3. **Position Data Extraction:**
   - Standard MPos/WPos formats
   - Alternative coordinate formats (X:, Y:, Z:, C:)
   - Hybrid coordinate selection (Work for X,Y,C, Machine for Z)
   - Fallback parsing for partial messages

### üìã **Supported FluidNC Message Formats:**

```
Standard Status:     <Idle|MPos:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000|WPos:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000|FS:0,0>
During Movement:     <Run|MPos:10.123,20.456,30.789,40.012|WPos:10.123,20.456,30.789,40.012|FS:100,500>
Jog Commands:        <Jog|MPos:5.123,10.456,15.789,20.012|FS:0,0>
Homing:             <Home|MPos:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000>
Position Only:       MPos:15.123,25.456,35.789,45.012
Alternative:         X:15.123 Y:25.456 Z:35.789 C:45.012
6-Axis Machines:     <Idle|MPos:1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0|WPos:1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0|FS:0,0>
```

### üéØ **Key Improvements:**

‚úÖ **Universal Parsing**: Extracts position from ANY message containing coordinates
‚úÖ **Multiple Patterns**: Handles various FluidNC firmware versions and configurations  
‚úÖ **Flexible Format**: Tolerates spacing, formatting, and axis count variations
‚úÖ **Enhanced Logging**: Debug information for unrecognized formats to improve parsing
‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: Processes all messages immediately for maximum responsiveness

### üîç **Debug Features:**

- Logs all significant messages for analysis
- Identifies unrecognized position formats for improvement
- Shows exact coordinate values and parsing decisions
- Tracks position update frequency and change detection

**The enhanced parsing should now capture position updates from ALL FluidNC messages, providing maximum responsiveness for the web interface!**

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Deploy to Pi** and monitor FluidNC communication
2. **Check logs** for "Processing:" messages to see all captured data
3. **Look for "Unrecognized status format"** messages to identify any missed patterns
4. **Verify position updates** appear immediately during movement
5. **Test different FluidNC operations** (jog, run, home) to ensure all are captured

The system should now respond immediately to all FluidNC position changes regardless of message format!
