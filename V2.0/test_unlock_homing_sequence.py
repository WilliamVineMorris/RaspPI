"""
Test script to verify improved unlock and homing sequence.

This script tests the enhanced homing implementation that:
1. Performs robust $X unlock with multiple attempts
2. Validates unlock success before proceeding
3. Adds proper timing between unlock and homing
4. Provides detailed logging of unlock process
