"""
Test script to verify improved alarm state detection and status querying.

This script tests the enhanced status management that:
1. Uses cached status for normal operations (no polling during movement)
2. Actively queries status only when needed (before homing)
3. Properly detects alarm state before homing attempts
4. Verifies status after unlock operations
