# Coordinate Update Timing Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified

You were absolutely right - **coordinate display was delayed** even though movement timing was fast. The issue was:

1. **Movement completes quickly** (~500ms with optimizations) ✅
2. **Fresh position retrieved** immediately after movement ✅  
3. **BUT:** Background monitor **overwrites** fresh position with stale data ❌
4. **Result:** Web UI shows delayed coordinates until background monitor catches up

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

Looking at your logs:
- Movement completed: `14:47:16,345` with fresh Z=29.524
- Background monitor kept showing: Z=29.807, Z=30.405 (stale data)
- **Delay:** 3-6 seconds before UI showed correct position

The background monitor runs every ~200ms and was **immediately overwriting** the fresh position data retrieved right after movement completion.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Position Timestamp Protection
**Location:** `motion/fluidnc_controller.py` - `move_relative()` method

```python
# CRITICAL: Update position timestamp to mark this as fresh data
# This prevents background monitor from immediately overwriting it with stale data
self.last_position_update = time.time()
```

### 2. Fresh Data Preservation in get_current_position()
**Location:** `motion/fluidnc_controller.py` - `get_current_position()` method

```python
# Update timestamp to mark this as fresh data (prevents background monitor overwrites)
self.last_position_update = time.time()
```

### 3. Smart Background Monitor Updates
**Location:** `motion/fluidnc_controller.py` - background monitor loop

```python
# SMART UPDATE: Don't overwrite very recent fresh position data from movement commands
data_age = current_time - self.last_position_update if self.last_position_update else 999.0

if data_age > 1.0 or position_changed:  # Update if data is >1s old OR position actually changed
    self.current_position = position
    self.last_position_update = current_time
else:
    # Skip update - we have fresher data from a recent movement command
    logger.debug("⏭️ Skipping background position update (fresh data)")
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Movement completes: 500ms ✅
- Coordinate update: 3-6 seconds ❌
- **User experience:** Fast movement, delayed display

### After Fix:
- Movement completes: 500ms ✅  
- Coordinate update: <100ms ✅
- **User experience:** Fast movement, immediate coordinate display

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Start web interface:** `python run_web_interface.py`

2. **Test jog movements:** Use small Z movements (±1mm)

3. **Watch for:**
   - **Movement timing:** Should complete in ~500ms
   - **Coordinate display:** Should update immediately in web UI
   - **Log messages:** Look for "Skipping background position update (fresh data)"

4. **Expected behavior:**
   - Jog command completes quickly
   - Web UI coordinates update immediately
   - No 3-6 second delay in position display

## 🔍 Debug Information

The logs should now show:
- ✅ Fast movement completion: "FluidNC IDLE with stable position (fast movement)"
- ✅ Immediate fresh position: "Final position after relative move: ..."
- ✅ Protection from overwrites: "Skipping background position update (fresh data ...)"

## 💡 Technical Details

**The core issue was a race condition:**
1. Movement completes → get fresh position → update cache
2. Background monitor (200ms later) → overwrites with stale data
3. Web UI polls status → gets stale position

**The fix implements timestamp-based data freshness:**
- Fresh position updates mark timestamp
- Background monitor respects recent data
- Only overwrites if >1 second old OR position actually changed

**This preserves real-time responsiveness while maintaining background monitoring reliability.**
