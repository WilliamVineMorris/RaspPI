"""
Test script to verify alarm clearing and post-homing unlock functionality.

This script tests the enhanced alarm handling that:
1. Clears alarm state before homing attempts
2. Performs post-homing unlock automatically
3. Provides manual alarm clearing for web interface
4. Validates system status after operations
