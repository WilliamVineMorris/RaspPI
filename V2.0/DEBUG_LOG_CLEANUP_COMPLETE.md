# Debug Log Cleanup - Complete

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Purpose**: Remove verbose debug logging added during C-axis troubleshooting

---

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up verbose debug logs that were added to track the C-axis position bug. The logs served their purpose in identifying the root cause (callback using wrong dictionary key), and have now been removed to provide cleaner production output.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `motion/simplified_fluidnc_protocol_fixed.py`

**Lines Cleaned:**
- **Line ~593**: Removed RAW MPos debug log
  ```python
  # REMOVED: logger.info(f"üîç RAW FluidNC MPos: '{coords_str}' ‚Üí {len(coords)} coordinates")
  ```

- **Line ~621**: Removed PARSED coordinates debug log
  ```python
  # REMOVED: Multi-line logging showing parsed X, Y, Z, A, B, C values
  ```

- **Lines ~324-354**: Removed protocol command transmission logs
  ```python
  # REMOVED: "üì§ PROTOCOL DEBUG: Sending command"
  # REMOVED: "üì§ PROTOCOL DEBUG: Writing to serial"
  # REMOVED: "üì§ PROTOCOL DEBUG: Command written and flushed"
  # REMOVED: "üì• PROTOCOL DEBUG: Waiting for response"
  # REMOVED: "üì• PROTOCOL DEBUG: FluidNC immediate response"
  ```

- **Lines ~370-394**: Cleaned up error response prefixes
  ```python
  # Changed from: logger.error(f"‚ùå PROTOCOL DEBUG: Error response...")
  # Changed to:   logger.error(f"‚ùå Error response...")
  # Kept error details but removed "PROTOCOL DEBUG" prefix
  ```

**Impact**: Cleaner FluidNC communication logs while preserving error reporting

---

### 2. `web/web_interface.py`

**Lines Cleaned:**
- **Line ~2382**: Removed C-axis value debug log
  ```python
  # REMOVED: self.logger.info(f"üîç STATUS API: Sending C-axis to web UI: {c_value}¬∞ (full position: {position})")
  ```

- **Lines ~2386-2390**: Removed data staleness debug logs
  ```python
  # REMOVED: Position age warning/success logs
  # These were checking if position data was stale during debugging
  ```

- **Line ~2461**: Removed extracted values debug log
  ```python
  # REMOVED: self.logger.info(f"üîç STATUS API: Extracted position values - X:{x_val}, Y:{y_val}, Z:{z_val}, C:{c_val}")
  ```

- **Line ~2471**: Removed final position dict debug log
  ```python
  # REMOVED: self.logger.info(f"üîç STATUS API: Final position_dict being sent: {position_dict}")
  ```

**Impact**: Cleaner status API logs, position updates no longer spam console

---

### 3. `scanning/scan_orchestrator.py`

**Lines Cleaned:**
- **Line ~1229**: Changed frame capture log from INFO to DEBUG
  ```python
  # Changed from: self.logger.info(f"CAMERA: Raw frame captured: {frame_array.shape}, dtype: {frame_array.dtype}")
  # Changed to:   self.logger.debug(f"Raw frame captured: {frame_array.shape}, dtype: {frame_array.dtype}")
  ```

- **Line ~1235**: Changed format conversion log from INFO to DEBUG
  ```python
  # Changed from: self.logger.info(f"CAMERA: Converted XBGR8888 to BGR: {frame_bgr.shape}")
  # Changed to:   self.logger.debug(f"Converted XBGR8888 to BGR: {frame_bgr.shape}")
  ```

**Impact**: Frame capture no longer logs ~15 messages per second at INFO level

**Note**: Configuration and initialization "CAMERA:" logs were preserved as they only appear once during startup and are useful for diagnostics.

---

## Debug Logs Preserved

The following debug logs were kept as they serve ongoing diagnostic purposes:

### Motion Layer
- Connection status checks
- Error responses with details
- Timing debug logs (at DEBUG level)

### Web Interface  
- Connection check failures
- Error responses
- Activity log entries

### Camera System
- Initialization messages
- Configuration details
- Mode switching
- Error messages

---

## Testing Impact

**Before Cleanup:**
```
üîç RAW FluidNC MPos: '200,137.5,0,0,0,-25' ‚Üí 6 coordinates
üîç PARSED (6 axes): [200.0, 137.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -25.0] ‚Üí X=200.0, Y=137.5, Z=0.0, C=-25.0
üì§ PROTOCOL DEBUG: Sending command: '$J=G91 X0 Y0 Z0 C10 F2000'
üì§ PROTOCOL DEBUG: Writing to serial...
üì§ PROTOCOL DEBUG: Command written and flushed
üì• PROTOCOL DEBUG: Waiting for response...
üì• PROTOCOL DEBUG: FluidNC immediate response: 'ok'
üîç STATUS API: Sending C-axis to web UI: -25.0¬∞
üîç STATUS API: Extracted position values - X:200.0, Y:137.5, Z:0.0, C:-25.0
üîç STATUS API: Final position_dict being sent: {'x': 200.0, 'y': 137.5, 'z': 0.0, 'c': -25.0, ...}
CAMERA: Raw frame captured: (1080, 1920, 3), dtype: uint8
CAMERA: Raw frame captured: (1080, 1920, 3), dtype: uint8
CAMERA: Raw frame captured: (1080, 1920, 3), dtype: uint8
... (repeated ~15 times per second)
```

**After Cleanup:**
```
(Clean execution - errors and warnings still visible)
(Camera frame logs only visible with DEBUG level enabled)
```

---

## Verification Steps

To verify the cleanup was successful:

1. **Restart web interface**:
   ```bash
   cd RaspPI/V2.0
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Execute jog commands** via web UI

3. **Check logs** - Should see:
   - ‚úÖ No "üîç RAW FluidNC MPos" messages
   - ‚úÖ No "üîç PARSED" coordinate dumps
   - ‚úÖ No "üì§ PROTOCOL DEBUG" send/receive logs
   - ‚úÖ No "üîç STATUS API" position extraction logs
   - ‚úÖ No repeated "CAMERA: Raw frame captured" messages (unless DEBUG level)
   - ‚úÖ Errors and warnings still visible
   - ‚úÖ Initialization messages still visible

4. **Verify functionality**:
   - C-axis position updates correctly ‚úÖ
   - No reset to 0 behavior ‚úÖ
   - 3D visualization updates in real-time ‚úÖ
   - Camera streaming works ‚úÖ

---

## Root Cause Fix (Preserved)

The actual C-axis bug fix in `simplified_fluidnc_controller_fixed.py` line 1316 was **NOT** modified:

```python
# Line 1316 - ROOT CAUSE FIX (kept intact)
c=status.position.get('c', 0.0)  # Uses correct 'c' key (was 'a')
```

All debug logging that helped discover this bug has been removed, but the fix itself remains in place.

---

## Log Levels Reference

After cleanup, the codebase uses these log levels:

- **DEBUG**: Detailed execution flow (frame captures, protocol details)
- **INFO**: Important state changes (initialization, mode switches, commands)
- **WARNING**: Recoverable issues (connection retries, fallback values)
- **ERROR**: Failures requiring attention (camera errors, protocol failures)

To enable DEBUG logs for troubleshooting:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **FluidNC protocol logs**: Cleaned (removed verbose send/receive debug)  
‚úÖ **Web interface status API**: Cleaned (removed position extraction debug)  
‚úÖ **Camera capture logs**: Cleaned (changed INFO ‚Üí DEBUG level)  
‚úÖ **Error reporting**: Preserved (still shows warnings and errors)  
‚úÖ **Initialization logs**: Preserved (useful for diagnostics)  
‚úÖ **Functionality**: Unchanged (C-axis fix still working)

**Production Ready**: The codebase now has clean, informative logs suitable for deployment on Raspberry Pi hardware.
