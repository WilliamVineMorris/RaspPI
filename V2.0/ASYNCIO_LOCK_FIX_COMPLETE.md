# Asyncio Lock Event Loop Fix - Complete Solution

## üö® Critical Issue Resolved
The "is bound to a different event loop" error has been comprehensively fixed in the FluidNC controller.

## üîß Solution Implementation

### 1. **Lazy Lock Initialization**
- Changed `self.connection_lock = asyncio.Lock()` to `self.connection_lock = None` in `__init__`
- Locks are now created only when needed in the correct event loop context

### 2. **Event Loop-Aware Lock Creation**
```python
async def _get_connection_lock(self):
    """Get connection lock, creating it in the current event loop if needed"""
    if self.connection_lock is None:
        # Create lock in current event loop
        self.connection_lock = asyncio.Lock()
    else:
        # Force recreation to ensure event loop compatibility
        self.connection_lock = asyncio.Lock()
    return self.connection_lock
```

### 3. **Universal Context Manager**
```python
class _LockContextManager:
    """Async context manager that handles both asyncio.Lock and threading.Lock"""
    async def __aenter__(self):
        if self.is_async:
            await self.lock.__aenter__()
        else:
            self.lock.__enter__()
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self.is_async:
            await self.lock.__aexit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)
        else:
            self.lock.__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)
```

### 4. **Updated Usage Pattern**
```python
# OLD (causing event loop errors):
async with self.connection_lock:
    # code here

# NEW (event loop safe):
lock = await self._get_connection_lock()
async with self._LockContextManager(lock):
    # code here
```

## üöÄ Production WSGI Server Added

### Gunicorn Integration
- Added `gunicorn>=20.1.0` to requirements.txt
- Production mode now uses Gunicorn WSGI server instead of Flask development server
- Automatically detects production mode and switches to appropriate server

### Usage:
```bash
# Development (Flask dev server)
python run_web_interface.py --mode development

# Production (Gunicorn WSGI server)  
python run_web_interface.py --mode production
```

## üìù **RESTART REQUIRED**

To clear any existing stuck locks and apply the fixes:

1. **Stop the current web interface** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Install Gunicorn**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/RaspPI/V2.0
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Restart with production server**:
   ```bash
   python run_web_interface.py --mode production --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
   ```

## ‚úÖ Expected Results After Restart

1. **No more "bound to different event loop" errors**
2. **Background monitor will start successfully**
3. **Position updates will resume 200ms responsiveness**
4. **No more "Background monitor data is stale" warnings**
5. **Gunicorn WSGI server for better production performance**
6. **Alarm state checking will work reliably**

## üß™ Testing Script Available

Run `python test_lock_fix.py` to verify the lock fix works correctly without starting the full system.

## üîç What Was Fixed

1. **Root Cause**: asyncio.Lock created during class initialization in wrong event loop
2. **Event Loop Binding**: Locks now always created in current running event loop
3. **Thread Safety**: Fallback to threading.Lock when no event loop available
4. **Context Management**: Universal async context manager handles both lock types
5. **Production Ready**: Gunicorn WSGI server for production deployments

The system should now run stably without any asyncio event loop conflicts.
