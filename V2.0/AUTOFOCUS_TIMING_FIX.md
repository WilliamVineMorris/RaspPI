# Autofocus Timing Fix - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Identified
The autofocus was happening **before** the scan started (during setup phase), which meant:
- Cameras were focusing on whatever was in view at the home position
- No actual object in the field of view to focus on
- Suboptimal focus for the actual scan subject

## âœ… Solution Implemented
**Moved autofocus to the first scan point** where the cameras can properly focus on the object being scanned.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. Modified Scan Orchestrator Flow (`scanning/scan_orchestrator.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# Home the system
await self._home_system()

# Setup focus for scan (WRONG - no object in view)
await self._setup_scan_focus()

# Execute scan points
await self._execute_scan_points()
```

**After:**
```python
# Home the system  
await self._home_system()

# Focus will be set up at the first scan point for object-based focusing
self.logger.info("Focus will be configured at first scan point")

# Execute scan points (focus happens at first point)
await self._execute_scan_points()
```

### 2. Added Focus Setup at First Scan Point

**In `_execute_scan_points()` method:**
```python
for i, point in enumerate(scan_points):
    # Move to position
    await self._move_to_point(point)
    
    # Setup focus at first point so cameras can focus on the object
    if i == 0:
        self.logger.info("ðŸŽ¯ Setting up focus at first scan point for object-based focusing")
        await self._setup_scan_focus()
        self.logger.info("âœ… Focus setup completed at first scan point")
    
    # Capture images
    images_captured = await self._capture_at_point(point, i)
```

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated method docstring to reflect new timing
- Added explanatory log messages for clarity

## ðŸš€ Expected Behavior Now

1. **System starts scan** â†’ homes axes
2. **Moves to first scan position** â†’ object is now in camera view
3. **Performs autofocus** â†’ cameras focus on the actual object
4. **Captures images** â†’ with proper focus on the object
5. **Continues with remaining points** â†’ using the same optimal focus value

## ðŸ“Š Benefits

- âœ… **Accurate Focus**: Cameras focus on the actual scan object
- âœ… **Consistent Results**: Same focus value used for entire scan
- âœ… **No Performance Impact**: Focus setup only happens once at first point
- âœ… **Better Image Quality**: Properly focused images throughout scan

## ðŸ§ª Testing

The fix is ready for testing on Pi hardware. Expected log sequence:
```
2025-09-27 XX:XX:XX - INFO - Focus will be configured at first scan point
2025-09-27 XX:XX:XX - INFO - Starting scan points execution  
2025-09-27 XX:XX:XX - INFO - ðŸŽ¯ Setting up focus at first scan point for object-based focusing
2025-09-27 XX:XX:XX - INFO - âœ… Autofocus completed. Optimal focus value: X.XXX
2025-09-27 XX:XX:XX - INFO - âœ… Focus setup completed at first scan point
```

This should resolve the autofocus timing issue and provide much better focus accuracy for scan subjects! ðŸŽ¯
