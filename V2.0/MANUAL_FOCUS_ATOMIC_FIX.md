# Manual Focus Atomic Fix - Root Cause Solution

## Critical Discovery: The Dashboard Comparison

### User Insight
"Please check how the manual focus on the dashboard works since that seems to correctly set the focus"

**This was the breakthrough!** The dashboard's manual focus control works perfectly, but calibration was failing. Comparing the two revealed the root cause.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Dashboard Manual Focus (WORKING ‚úÖ)
```python
# From set_focus_value() - works perfectly
picamera2.set_controls({
    "AfMode": 0,       # Manual focus
    "LensPosition": 511  # Target position
})
```

**Why it works:** Sets ONLY manual focus controls, no auto-exposure interference.

### Calibration Manual Focus (BROKEN ‚ùå)
```python
# BEFORE FIX - two separate set_controls() calls:

# Call 1: Enable auto-exposure
control_dict = {
    "AeEnable": True,      # ‚Üê Enables auto-exposure
    "AeExposureMode": 0,   # ‚Üê May trigger auto-focus!
    # ... other controls
}
picamera2.set_controls(control_dict)

# Call 2: 0.2 seconds later, try to set manual focus
picamera2.set_controls({
    "AfMode": 0,
    "LensPosition": 511
})
```

**Why it failed:**
1. First `set_controls()` enables auto-exposure (`AeEnable: True`)
2. Camera firmware **may automatically enable auto-focus** to help with exposure metering
3. Lens moves to default position (15) for AE calculation
4. 0.2 seconds later, we try to set manual focus
5. **TOO LATE** - camera is already in AE mode, manual focus gets overridden or ignored

### The Timing Problem

```
Time 0ms:    set_controls({AeEnable: True})
             ‚Üì Camera firmware: "Oh, auto-exposure? Let me help with auto-focus too!"
Time 10ms:   Lens moves to position 15 (default for AE)
Time 200ms:  set_controls({AfMode: 0, LensPosition: 511})
             ‚Üì Camera firmware: "But I'm doing auto-exposure, ignoring manual focus"
Time 201ms:  Lens position still at 15 ‚ùå
```

## The Atomic Solution

### Fix: Set Everything in ONE `set_controls()` Call

```python
# NEW APPROACH - single atomic call:

control_dict = {
    "AeEnable": True,       # Enable auto-exposure
    "AeExposureMode": 0,    # Auto-exposure mode
    # ... other exposure controls ...
    "AfMode": 0,            # ‚Üê ADD: Manual focus mode
    "LensPosition": 511     # ‚Üê ADD: Target lens position
}

# Set EVERYTHING at once - no time gap for camera to interfere
picamera2.set_controls(control_dict)
```

**Why it works:**
1. Camera receives ALL controls simultaneously
2. Firmware sees: "Enable AE **AND** keep focus manual at position 511"
3. No opportunity for automatic auto-focus to activate
4. Lens stays at 511 throughout entire calibration ‚úÖ

## Code Changes

### File: `camera/pi_camera_controller.py`

**Lines ~1256-1268** - Add manual focus to control_dict BEFORE set_controls():

```python
# CRITICAL: If skip_autofocus=True (manual focus mode), add manual focus controls
# to control_dict BEFORE calling set_controls() to prevent AeEnable from overriding focus
if skip_autofocus:
    cam_id = int(camera_id.replace('camera', ''))
    cam_id_str = f"camera{cam_id}"
    if hasattr(self, '_stored_focus_values') and cam_id_str in self._stored_focus_values:
        stored_focus = self._stored_focus_values[cam_id_str]
        lens_position_manual = int((1.0 - stored_focus) * 1023)
        # Add manual focus to the same control_dict to set atomically with AeEnable
        control_dict["AfMode"] = 0  # Manual focus mode
        control_dict["LensPosition"] = lens_position_manual
        logger.info(f"üîß Camera {camera_id} adding manual focus to control_dict: AfMode=0, LensPosition={lens_position_manual} (focus {stored_focus:.3f})")

# Set all controls atomically (exposure + focus together)
picamera2.set_controls(control_dict)
logger.info(f"üì∑ Camera {camera_id} applied controls: {list(control_dict.keys())}")
```

**Key Points:**
- Manual focus controls added to `control_dict` **BEFORE** `set_controls()` is called
- Everything applied in **ONE atomic operation**
- No time gap for camera firmware to interfere
- Removed separate "reapplication" call - no longer needed!

### Kept: Second Reapplication After AE Settling

The second reapplication after AE settling loop is **kept as a safety measure** in case `capture_metadata()` calls can reset focus:

```python
# CRITICAL: Reapply manual focus AGAIN after AE settling
if skip_autofocus:
    stored_focus = self._stored_focus_values[cam_id_str]
    lens_position_manual = int((1.0 - stored_focus) * 1023)
    picamera2.set_controls({
        "AfMode": 0,
        "LensPosition": lens_position_manual
    })
    logger.info(f"üîÑ Camera {camera_id} REAPPLIED manual focus {stored_focus:.3f} (lens {lens_position_manual}) AFTER AE settling")
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
```

This provides redundancy without harm.

### Removed: Third Reapplication (No Longer Needed)

The verification and third reapplication before final metadata capture has been **reverted** because:
1. If atomic setting works, focus should stay at 511
2. `capture_metadata()` alone doesn't call `set_controls()`, so shouldn't reset focus
3. Simpler is better - fewer moving parts

## Expected Log Sequence (Fixed)

**What You Should See NOW:**
```
üì∏ Converted focus 8 to normalized 0.500
üì∑ Camera camera0 enabling auto-exposure controls...
üîß Camera camera0 adding manual focus to control_dict: AfMode=0, LensPosition=511 (focus 0.500)  ‚Üê NEW!
üì∑ Camera camera0 applied controls: ['AeEnable', 'AeExposureMode', 'AfMode', 'LensPosition', ...]  ‚Üê ATOMIC!

üì∑ Camera camera0 letting auto-exposure settle...
üîÑ Camera camera0 REAPPLIED manual focus 0.500 (lens 511) AFTER AE settling  ‚Üê Safety backup

üì∑ Camera camera0 SKIPPING autofocus - manual focus mode
üì∑ Camera camera0 capturing final calibration values...
üì∑ Camera camera0 read current manual focus from metadata: 0.500 (lens position: 511)  ‚Üê SHOULD BE FIXED!
‚úÖ Camera camera0 calibration complete: Focus: 0.500  ‚Üê CORRECT!
```

**Key Difference:**
- NEW line showing manual focus added to control_dict **BEFORE** set_controls()
- No "REAPPLIED after exposure controls" message - not needed anymore
- Still have one reapplication after AE settling as safety backup

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Verification Points

1. **New Log Message:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ "adding manual focus to control_dict: AfMode=0, LensPosition=511"
   ```

2. **Atomic Application:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ "applied controls: ['AeEnable', ... 'AfMode', 'LensPosition', ...]"
   ```

3. **Correct Metadata Reading:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ "read current manual focus from metadata: 0.500 (lens position: 511)"
   NOT: "read current manual focus from metadata: 0.985 (lens position: 15.0)"
   ```

4. **Correct Calibration Result:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ "calibration complete: Focus: 0.500"
   NOT: "calibration complete: Focus: 0.985"
   ```

5. **Image Sharpness:**
   - All 24 images should be sharp and in focus
   - No variation in focus between points
   - Consistent sharpness across entire scan

### Test Procedure

1. Set manual focus mode, position 8.0mm
2. Start cylindrical scan (24 points)
3. Check logs for atomic control application
4. Verify metadata reads lens position **511** (not 15)
5. Verify calibration reports focus **0.500** (not 0.985)
6. Examine captured images for sharpness

## Why This Fix Is Better

### Previous Approach (Triple Reapplication)
- ‚ùå Three separate `set_controls()` calls
- ‚ùå Racing against camera firmware
- ‚ùå Trying to "fight" the camera's automatic behavior
- ‚ùå Complex timing dependencies
- ‚ùå Still failing because timing wasn't enough

### New Approach (Atomic Setting)
- ‚úÖ One `set_controls()` call with all parameters
- ‚úÖ No race conditions
- ‚úÖ Working **with** the camera firmware, not against it
- ‚úÖ Mimics dashboard behavior (which works)
- ‚úÖ Simpler, more reliable

## Technical Explanation

### Picamera2/libcamera Behavior

When `set_controls()` is called with `AeEnable: True`:

**Without manual focus controls:**
```
Camera Firmware Decision Tree:
AeEnable=True ‚Üí "Need to calculate exposure"
  ‚Üí "Should I also focus for better metering?"
    ‚Üí AfMode not specified ‚Üí Use default (auto)
      ‚Üí Enable auto-focus
        ‚Üí Move lens to default position (15)
```

**With manual focus controls (atomic):**
```
Camera Firmware Decision Tree:
AeEnable=True AND AfMode=0 AND LensPosition=511
  ‚Üí "Need to calculate exposure"
    ‚Üí "User wants manual focus at 511"
      ‚Üí Keep lens at 511
        ‚Üí Calculate exposure with lens at 511
          ‚Üí ‚úÖ Manual focus preserved!
```

### Why Dashboard Works

The dashboard never enables auto-exposure during livestream, so there's no AE/AF conflict:

```python
# Dashboard: Just set focus, no AE changes
picamera2.set_controls({
    "AfMode": 0,
    "LensPosition": 511
})
# ‚úÖ Works perfectly - no AE to interfere
```

### Why Calibration Failed Before

Calibration needs auto-exposure for optimal image capture, creating the AE/AF conflict:

```python
# OLD: Two separate calls = race condition
picamera2.set_controls({"AeEnable": True, ...})  # ‚Üê Triggers auto-focus
await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
picamera2.set_controls({"AfMode": 0, "LensPosition": 511})  # ‚Üê Too late!
```

### Why Calibration Works Now

```python
# NEW: Single call = atomic operation
picamera2.set_controls({
    "AeEnable": True,      # Need auto-exposure
    "AfMode": 0,           # But keep focus manual
    "LensPosition": 511    # At this position
})
# ‚úÖ Camera respects both AE and manual focus simultaneously
```

- `MANUAL_FOCUS_AE_SETTLING_FIX.md` - Double reapplication attempt
- `MANUAL_FOCUS_CALIBRATION_RESET_FIX.md` - Original single reapplication

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Fix is successful when:**
1. New log message shows manual focus added to control_dict
2. Metadata reads lens position 511 immediately (no resets)
3. Calibration reports focus 0.500
4. All scan images are sharp and in focus
5. Focus remains consistent across all 24 points
6. **Simpler code** - one atomic set instead of multiple reapplications

‚ùå **Fix has failed if:**
- Still seeing lens position 15 in metadata
- Calibration still reports focus 0.985
- Images are out of focus or vary in sharpness
- Multiple reapplications are still needed

## Implementation Date
- **Root Cause Discovery:** User question about dashboard comparison
- **Atomic Fix Implementation:** Current session
- **Status:** Ready for Pi hardware testing

**This should be the FINAL fix - addressing the root cause, not symptoms!**
